# **Fake News Detection**

## **Problem**
Misinformation presents a huge challenge in online society. As a result, there have been many attempts to identify and classify misinformation. Specifically, in social networking sites, blogs, as well as online newspapers. So, there is a strong need to classify all the fake news articles among the genuines.

## **Solution**
A lot of fake news are created day by day in multiple social media platforms and news sites. Manually classification news are not possible. So, here is a automated solution, which uses natural language processing tool and Machine Learning Classification Algorithym to automatically detect the fake ones.

## **Objectives**
1. Uses NLP to tokenize texts, and removes all the unwanted texts (eg. is, the, a, an). It makes the data more presized for accurate prediction
2. We have used a pre-classified data set, so supervised learning methods are used for classification. such as-\
    i. LogisticRegression\
    ii. RandomForest Classifier\
    iii. DecisionTree Classifier\
    iv. GradientBoosting Classifier
